I can't do this anymore.
I give up.
What's the point?
I hate it all.
There's nothing here.
I'm barren.
This is where I will die.
How do I get out of here?
There's no way out.
How do I leave?
There's a time to fight and a time to die. Time to die.
Things are looking bleak.
This is devastating.
This is the worst.
I don't want.
Keep playing your frivolous games.
I don't want to be here.
Feeling down.
Emptiness.
Empty inside.
I'm crushed. There is nothing.
It's unbearable.
We are all just delaying the inevitable.
Pain.
Sorrow.
Why me?
I am so small in this world.
The void.
